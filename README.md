# ðŸš€ Quadrotor_PID_control

## ðŸ“– Purpose Tools and zMethods
In today's world, drones play a crucial role in various fields such as inspection, search, and rescue. In these tasks, the ability of drones to autonomously navigate to target locations is essential for mission success.

The goal of this project is to achieve autonomous control of drones in the Gazebo simulation environment, including:

Position control: Precisely navigating to target points.
Attitude control: Ensuring the drone maintains stability during flight.
Autonomous flight: Utilizing ROS 2 for path planning and control, enabling fully autonomous navigation from the starting point to the target.
This project is based on ROS 2 + Gazebo and implements control algorithms (such as PID and MPC) to optimize drone navigation and stability.
